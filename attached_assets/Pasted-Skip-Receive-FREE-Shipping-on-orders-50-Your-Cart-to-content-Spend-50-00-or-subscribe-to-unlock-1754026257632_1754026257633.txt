At Looner, we use plant-derived Delta-9 THC — extracted directly from hemp using a clean, natural process. While some THC on the market is chemically altered or synthesized from CBD, we keep it simple. No weird lab conversions, no shortcuts — just real THC, straight from the plant. It's the kind of quality you can feel good about, in every can.
Naturally Derived. Always.
KNOW THE FACTS
Fresh from the land of 10,000 lakes, Looner is proudly crafted in-house in Spring Lake Park, Minnesota. We keep things simple: great taste, high-quality, and products you can trust.

We focus on the classics-simplicity at its best. Looner brings you the nostalgic joy of craft sodas, with pure hemp-derived THC.

Every Looner beverage is a labor of love - built for chill moments, big laughs, and the kind of hangout that doesn’t come with a hangover. Whether you’re on the lake, unwinding after work, or just want something fun to sip at the party, Looner’s got you.
Proudly Made in Minnesota
