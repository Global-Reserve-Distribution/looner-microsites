# Shopify Webhooks Setup for Production

## Overview
Webhooks provide real-time updates when data changes in Shopify, eliminating the need to refetch data on every page load.

```

```
Webhook Topic: inventory_levels/update
Endpoint: https://your-domain.replit.app/api/webhooks/inventory/update

## Implementation Steps (For Production)

### Step 1: Create Webhook Endpoints
Create API routes in your Next.js app to receive webhook data.

### Step 2: Configure in Shopify Admin
1. Go to Settings > Notifications in Shopify Admin
2. Add webhook endpoints for each topic above
3. Set format to JSON
4. Add webhook verification for security

### Step 3: Cache Strategy
Implement a caching layer (Redis or database) to store frequently accessed data.

### Step 4: Revalidation
Use Next.js revalidation to update static pages when webhooks fire.

## Current Status: Not Critical
Your current setup works well for development and moderate traffic. 
Implement webhooks before scaling to high traffic or when you notice:
- Slow page loads due to API calls
- Outdated product information
- High Shopify API usage

## Priority: Medium
Implement after core functionality is complete and before major traffic scaling.
